# Known Limitations and Divergences

Everything here is deliberate or known; none of it is hidden behind a "compatible" claim.

## Scope

- Only 33 of 321 upstream API operations are implemented. Others answer `501 {"message":"This endpoint is not
  implemented in coolify-rs yet."}`.
- The web UI covers the dashboard, projects, environments, private keys, team settings, members and appearance.
  Not available yet: registration and the root setup window, password reset and forced password change, 2FA
  enrollment and recovery codes, passkeys, OAuth/SSO, team creation and invitations, instance settings, API token
  management, and every page for servers, resources, sources, storages, notifications and tags (they open a "not
  available in coolify-rs yet" page).
- Within the ported pages: no canvas views, global search, project icons, team avatars or custom color themes;
  an environment that has resources says so instead of listing them; the dashboard's server status does not include
  the Traefik-outdated and Sentinel checks; table/grid choices are remembered per browser, not per user.
- Browser sessions live in memory: a restart signs everyone out. Session limits: 10,000 sessions, 7-day idle
  (`SESSION_LIFETIME`), 30-day absolute.
- Users must sign in with an existing Coolify account (created in upstream Coolify).
- Servers: validation works (API and UI); nothing else connects to a server yet. `instant_validate`, validating with
  `install=true` (installing prerequisites, Docker and the proxy), validating a server linked to Vultr, DigitalOcean or
  Hostinger, changing `proxy_type`, `DELETE ?force=true` on a server with resources, `delete_from_provider`, deleting
  a transferred server and `GET /servers/{uuid}?resources=1` answer 501; `/servers/{uuid}/resources`, `/domains` and
  the other server sub-routes are not ported.
- Validation from the UI does not install anything: the "this will install or update Docker" question upstream asks
  before revalidating is not shown, missing prerequisites or Docker end the validation with upstream's
  "install them manually" messages, and after success coolify-rs neither fetches the server details nor starts the
  proxy or Sentinel (upstream does all three).
- Validation jobs run inside the coolify-rs process: a restart drops a running validation (upstream's queue keeps it).
  Reachability changes do not send the Reachable/Unreachable notifications.
- Server status in the UI and in `/ui/*` omits the Sentinel and Traefik-update checks.
- `sentinel_custom_url` for a new server falls back to the request's scheme and host; `X-Forwarded-*` count only
  from trusted proxies (upstream trusts every proxy).
- The new-server page offers only "IP address or domain" (no cloud provisioning).
- No deployment engine, proxy management, backups, scheduler, notifications or webhooks yet. SSH runs without
  connection multiplexing (one connection per command).
- coolify-rs cannot bootstrap a new installation: it requires a database created by upstream Coolify at the baseline
  (`main` @ b5823c7, 473 migrations); it runs no upstream DDL. A 4.5.0 database is served read-only until upstream
  is upgraded.

## API divergences (implemented routes)

| Area | Upstream | coolify-rs | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client IP for the API allowlist | `TrustProxies('*')`: `X-Forwarded-For` trusted from anyone, so the leftmost (client-controlled) entry is used | peer address unless `COOLIFY_RS_TRUSTED_PROXIES` is set; then rightmost untrusted hop | security fix: the allowlist is spoofable upstream when the app is reachable without a proxy |
| `CF-Connecting-IP` on Coolify Cloud | honoured for any peer when `isCloud()` | not applicable | coolify-rs has no cloud mode; the self-hosted rule (Cloudflare peers only) is implemented |
| Rate limiting | `throttle:api` 200/min, `X-RateLimit-*` headers | none | not implemented yet |
| Audit events | `audit_events` rows for environment changes, auth failures, server validation | not written (remote commands and validations are logged to the `audit` tracing target) | not implemented yet |
| SSH host keys | not verified (`StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, `UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null`) | pinned per server on first use; a changed key fails with `Host key verification failed: the server's SSH host key changed ...` (new fingerprint and how to accept it); the pin is dropped when the IP or port changes or the server is deleted | security fix (ADR 0009); `COOLIFY_RS_SSH_HOST_KEYS=ignore` restores upstream's behaviour |
| SSH key files | written once to `storage/app/ssh/keys/ssh_key@<uuid>` and kept | written 0600 for the length of a command, then removed; errors still name the key `ssh_key@<uuid>` | key material stays off disk |
| SSH options | upstream's options with the operator's environment | adds `-F /dev/null`, `BatchMode`, `IdentitiesOnly`, no agent, no forwarding; environment cleared | a hostile server or operator config cannot change behaviour |
| Remote output size | unbounded | stdout capped at 16 MiB, stderr at 1 MiB | memory safety against a hostile server |
| Validation throttle on Coolify Cloud | per-IP and per-team limits | none | coolify-rs is self-hosted only (upstream applies none there either) |
| Environment details with resources | applications/databases/services serialized with sensitive-field rules | `501` | refusing is safer than partial or unfiltered data |
| Validation of non-string values for string fields | Laravel continues evaluating min/max/regex | only "must be a string" is reported | rare; documented |
| Concurrent duplicate environment names | unique index violation → 500 | 409 | improvement |
| Multi-row writes (project create/delete) | model hooks, no transaction | single transaction | improvement; same end state |
| Unknown columns from newer upstream releases | serialized automatically (`$hidden` is a deny-list) | dropped from output and logged until reviewed in `records.rs` | prevents leaking secret columns added upstream |
| Writes when the DB schema is newer than this build | n/a | read-only mode (`503`) unless `COOLIFY_RS_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_SCHEMA=true` | schema guard |
| Invalid `private_key` on `PATCH /security/keys/{uuid}` without `Accept: application/json` | model `ValidationException` → **302 redirect** to the app URL (upstream defect) | 422 JSON, the body upstream returns to JSON clients | API clients should not receive HTML redirects |

## Upstream defects observed (not reproduced as security issues, recorded for review)

- `Project::deleting` / `Environment::deleting` iterate a relation object instead of its results, so shared environment
  variables are likely **not** deleted (orphans). coolify-rs matches upstream's end state (does not delete them) pending
  runtime confirmation; candidate remediation once confirmed.
- SSH host keys are not verified (`StrictHostKeyChecking=no`). coolify-rs pins them (see API divergences).

## Verification gaps

- Upstream's own Pest suite was not run (PHP 8.4 unavailable locally; upstream CI does not run it either).
- Differential tests cover the implemented routes with fixtures for one instance; no fuzzing yet.
- `environment_variables.value` storage format (`encryptString` vs serialized `encrypt`) is inferred from source, not
  confirmed at runtime; the decrypter handles both.
- Migration engine classification is uncalibrated; risk rules are hand-written heuristics.
- The container image builds (see PROJECT_STATE.md) but no end-to-end deployment of coolify-rs beside a live upstream
  instance has been exercised beyond the local reference environment.
- Performance has not been measured for either implementation.
- Reproducible builds are not claimed: `Cargo.lock` and the toolchain are pinned, but bit-for-bit reproducibility was not
  verified.
